## Version 1.0.0: Major Update

### Key Changes

#### USA Questlines
- **Presidential Questline Adjustments**: To accommodate requests from speedrunners, we've made it **15.65% easier** to win over neutral or undecided players. However, we’ve increased the rabidity of already committed players by **12%**. Hopefully, this will ease the pressure from user **DonaldTrump111**.
- **World Peace Quest**: Due to some unforeseen glitches in the Ukraine-Russia region, this questline is currently on hold and locked. Stay tuned for updates.

#### Ukraine/Russia Conflict
- We are actively working to resolve the **aggression glitch** that has caused ongoing conflict. User **VladimirPutinRussia** has taken advantage of this issue. In the meantime, player health in the region has been increased by **50%**, but this may change as we assess the situation.

#### North Korea Questline
- **World Domination Quest**: User **KimJongUnDearLeader** has unexpectedly initiated the World Domination questline. In response, we’ve reduced nuclear explosion range by **86%** to manage the fallout.

#### Mars Questline
- The Mars questline is **98% complete**, with only the livable terrain and alien life remaining. User **ElonMuskDollarBill$** is eager to finalize this quest. Please note: the alien life will **NOT BE SENTIENT**—please stop asking!
- Additionally, research in rocket science has been made **15% more efficient**.

#### Conspiracy Theory DLC
- Minor adjustments have been made: prices for conspiracy theories are now **17% cheaper**. However, we have removed the options for **"Vaccines Cause Autism"** and **"Rigged Elections"** from the market due to their contribution to aggression and conflict. Some copies may still circulate on the user-funded **Facebook** and the new **X** markets.

### Additional Notes
- **Weather Incident in Florida**: We apologize to users in **Florida**. A recent security breach has led to the triggering of **Hurricane Milton**. Our dev team is working on a fix, but in the meantime, consider relocating to **Alabama** or **Georgia**, AND LEAVE THE ALLIGATORS behind; the clean-up team does not need to be hunting in-bred alligators.

- **PvP Request**: To our PvP players: please refrain from using Ukraine and Israel as battlegrounds. We’ve added **AirSoft** options per your request, yet you continue to engage in conflict. This is not helping with the aggression glitch.

- **Ban System**: The ban system is currently down due to a surge of requests to ban user **VladimirPutinRussia**. We’re addressing this issue as quickly as possible.

- **EU and European Updates**: No significant changes are planned for the EU and Europe at this time. However, we are working on enhancing German efficiency and worsening the weather in Britain.
