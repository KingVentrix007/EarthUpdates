## Side Notes
- The Australian Spawn region is **VERY GLITCHY**. Frequent wild life model glitches, resulting in massive wild life, frequent temperature glitches, and texture loss issues.
- The India Spawn region is **Largely overpopulated**, so we don`t recommend spawning there.
- User **JeffBezosRainForest1** has been abusing an infinite money glitch, any players caught using this glitch will be banned.
