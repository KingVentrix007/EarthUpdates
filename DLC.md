# DLCs

DLCs in *Earth: The Game* offer a wide array of additional content. From behind-the-scenes conspiracy theories to full-on life-hack packs to smooth out your experience, there’s something for everyone.

## Conspiracy Theories

- **Fake Moon Landing**  
  This DLC provides players with behind-the-scenes footage of the *Moon Landing Quest* completion. Due to unforeseen issues, quest users were redirected to a backup server as the Moon was still in development when user **NeilArmstrongSpaceMan** and his team arrived.

- **Lizards Run the US**  
  Adds the ability to see through the re-texturing of select U.S. government officials. Originally, they were models from *Lizard Life*, but with subtle re-textures to hide tails and scales. Download this for an amusing alternate view of world politics!

- **Area 51 Secrets**  
  With this DLC, you can access hidden government files within Area 51, uncovering documents about “aliens” that reveal they were simply canceled NPC models for a *Mars Questline* expansion. Get a glimpse into early dev concepts that didn’t make the final cut!

- **Bigfoot Sightings**  
  Adds Bigfoot sightings across rural areas globally, with new easter egg quests to track down the elusive NPC model. Rumor has it Bigfoot was an abandoned early-stage character model for *Lizard Life* and still roams the backend code in random patches.

- **HAARP Weather Control**  
  In this DLC, access a control panel to trigger and modify various weather patterns. A remnant tool from the original dev team, you can now adjust rainfall, control storms, and even simulate lightning strikes, though with a limited power source and some erratic behavior.

- **The Illuminati Network**  
  Gain access to an underground community of players supposedly controlling global financial and social events. Provides a VIP chat room, special insider quests, and secret meeting points. **Warning:** High aggression and paranoia may ensue.

- **Chemtrails Control Center**  
  This DLC includes an updated environment panel that allows you to adjust atmospheric settings in the skies, which some players call "chemtrails." Originally used by devs for environmental testing, it's now a mysterious "bonus" feature that has sparked much debate among players.

- **Mandela Effect Memory Patch**  
  Adds a "Memory Sync" feature that lets you experience slight changes in historical events and remember things differently from other players. Originally a bug, this feature now lets you explore a slightly alternate history and is a favorite among hardcore lore-enthusiasts.
  
- **9 to 5 Matrix**  
  The *Matrix* add-on lets you experience heightened productivity and efficiency in routine tasks by "unlocking" areas of the brain supposedly underused. Known for blurring the lines between in-game work and real-life productivity.
