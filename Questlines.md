---
- **Extra info**: Due to **Earth: The game** changing ownership multiple times, lots of code for older pre-2000 Questlines have been lost, so they are not included, and due to **EA** taking over for the BC era, almost all quests were lost due to a glitch in the paywall system. So we do apologize.
